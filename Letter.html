    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
        <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> of your 
    <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PHD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.  
         </p>
    <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
        <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
    could start at the beginning of a semester; the start date for each one are as follows:       
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
        <p>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
    You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">Important university dates</a> on our website
        </p>
    <h2>Subject of study</h2>
        <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subject fall<br>
    somwehere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
    by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Reservatol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<span>&#176;</span>C (86<span>&#176;</span>F), when the<br>
        audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.) </li>
        <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
    researcher to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>
    <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
        <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
    my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em>influential dance datinig back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>a whole village would dance around<br>
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
        involved huddliing close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impercebtibly<br>
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
        modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960's believed to have<br>
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilled movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
        because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>
        <p>

    Yours sincerely,<br><br>
